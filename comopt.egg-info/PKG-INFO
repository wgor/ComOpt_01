Description: The Commitment Optimisation package for energy loans demonstrates interactions between different stakeholders trading energy flexibility as part of a smart energy system.
        The package supports multi-agent simulations in which each stakeholder is represented as an independent decision-maker (agent) with limited information.
        A simulation is executed as a Markov Decision Process from the perspective of one of the agents: the Aggregator.
